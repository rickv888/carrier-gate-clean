# CarrierGate Clean Room

This repository is a clean-room rebuild.

Rules:
- CarrierGate only.
- Follow the master contract pasted by the user. If a spec is missing or ambiguous, stop and report the gap.
- Do not invent tables, columns, enums, or workflows.
- Output only what is explicitly requested.
- SQL must be rerunnable and safe for Supabase.

Initial deliverables:
- schema.sql
- rls.sql
- functions.sql
🔒 CARRIERGATE MASTER CONTRACT — v1.0 (MODEL A, LOCKED) EK-2025-12-28-CARRIERGATE-FRESHSTART + Thread Initialization Kit  This document is the sole source of truth for this thread. All reasoning, schema, code, and decisions must conform to it. If a conflict or gap exists, execution stops and the gap is reported. Do not invent. Do not merge. Do not “minimum field” anything.  ======================== 0) Objective ======================== Build CarrierGate as a broker-side carrier verification and document intake gate with: 1) Broker creates a Doc Request for a carrier 2) System issues a one time expiring token link to carrier 3) Carrier uploads required documents using signed upload flow 4) Broker reviews and decides accept or reject per document 5) Full audit trail for every action  ======================== 1) Stack Lock ======================== Backend: Next.js (App Router) or Express. Pick one and stay consistent. Database: Supabase Postgres. Storage: Supabase Storage private buckets. Deploy: Render or Railway. Do not mix deploy surfaces for MVP. No external workflow tools for MVP.  ======================== 2) Canonical Data Model ======================== All tables are in public schema.  2.1 Enums (LOCKED) public.doc_request_status: - OPEN - SUBMITTED - EXPIRED - CANCELED  public.upload_status: - RECEIVED - QUARANTINED - REJECTED - ACCEPTED  public.upload_event_type: - CREATED - FILE_UPLOADED - STATUS_CHANGED - NOTE_ADDED  2.2 Tables (LOCKED)  A) api_clients - id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid() - name text not null - is_active boolean not null default true - created_at timestamptz not null default now()  B) gate_runs - id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid() - api_client_id uuid not null references api_clients(id) - gate_name text not null - result text not null check (result in ('PASS','FAIL')) - reason text - created_at timestamptz not null default now()  C) doc_requests - id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid() - broker_org_id uuid not null - carrier_org_id uuid - verification_id uuid not null - required_docs jsonb not null - status public.doc_request_status not null default 'OPEN' - expires_at timestamptz not null - submitted_at timestamptz - created_at timestamptz not null default now() - updated_at timestamptz not null default now()  Rules: - required_docs is a json array of objects with at least: { "doc_type": "cab_card", "required": true } Doc types are free text but must be stable across UI and DB. - expires_at is server authoritative. - status transitions are enforced by functions only.  D) doc_request_tokens - id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid() - doc_request_id uuid not null references doc_requests(id) on delete cascade - token_hash text not null unique - expires_at timestamptz not null - used_at timestamptz - is_revoked boolean not null default false - created_at timestamptz not null default now()  Rules: - One active token per doc_request at a time. - used_at set once when first successful token resolution happens.  E) uploads - id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid() - doc_request_id uuid not null references doc_requests(id) on delete cascade - doc_type text not null - storage_bucket text not null - storage_path text not null - file_name text - content_type text - byte_size bigint - sha256 text - status public.upload_status not null default 'RECEIVED' - created_at timestamptz not null default now() - updated_at timestamptz not null default now()  Constraints: - unique (doc_request_id, doc_type) Meaning: one latest upload per doc_type per doc_request.  F) upload_events - id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid() - upload_id uuid not null references uploads(id) on delete cascade - event_type public.upload_event_type not null - actor_type text not null check (actor_type in ('BROKER','CARRIER','SYSTEM','API')) - actor_id uuid - note text - created_at timestamptz not null default now()  ======================== 3) Storage Lock ======================== Buckets (private): - carrier-uploads - audit-artifacts  Path convention (LOCKED): carrier-uploads/ doc_requests/{doc_request_id}/{doc_type}/{upload_id}/{original_filename}  No other path formats.  No public objects. No public URLs. All access is via signed URLs or server proxy.  ======================== 4) Token Hashing Lock ======================== Token format returned to broker: raw token string. Only hashed token is stored.  Hash algorithm (LOCKED): - token_hash = lower(hex(sha256(utf8(raw_token)))) - No salt. No HMAC for v1.0. Keep deterministic and testable. - raw token is generated server side using 32 random bytes base64url.  If Supabase SQL cannot do sha256 directly, hashing happens in server code. But hashing method must match exactly.  ======================== 5) Status Transition Rules ======================== Doc Request lifecycle: - OPEN: broker created and still collecting uploads - SUBMITTED: carrier indicates done uploading - EXPIRED: system sets when now() > expires_at - CANCELED: broker cancels  Allowed transitions (LOCKED): - OPEN -> SUBMITTED - OPEN -> CANCELED - OPEN -> EXPIRED (system only) - SUBMITTED -> EXPIRED (system only) No other transitions.  Upload status lifecycle: - RECEIVED default on create or file upload - QUARANTINED optional if automated scan flags - ACCEPTED broker decision - REJECTED broker decision  Allowed transitions (LOCKED): - RECEIVED -> ACCEPTED - RECEIVED -> REJECTED - RECEIVED -> QUARANTINED - QUARANTINED -> ACCEPTED - QUARANTINED -> REJECTED No direct ACCEPTED <-> REJECTED switches.  Every status change must write an upload_events row.  ======================== 6) Required DB Functions ======================== All functions are SECURITY DEFINER where appropriate. All must hard fail on invalid state.  F1) get_doc_request_by_token(raw_token text) returns: - doc_request fields needed for carrier upload page - token metadata for validity check  Rules: - Compute token_hash from raw_token using locked method. - Fail if token not found, revoked, used, or expired. - On success, set used_at if null and return doc_request.  F2) create_doc_request_and_token(broker_org_id uuid, carrier_org_id uuid, verification_id uuid, required_docs jsonb, ttl_minutes int) returns: - doc_request_id - raw_token - expires_at  Rules: - ttl_minutes bounds enforced server side. Default 60. Max 1440. - Create doc_requests row with expires_at. - Create doc_request_tokens row with token_hash and same expires_at.  F3) register_upload(doc_request_id uuid, doc_type text, file metadata, storage_bucket text, storage_path text, sha256 text) returns upload_id Rules: - Enforce doc_request.status in (OPEN, SUBMITTED) but if SUBMITTED then reject new uploads. - Upsert by (doc_request_id, doc_type) allowed only if prior status is RECEIVED. - Create upload_events CREATED or FILE_UPLOADED as needed.  F4) set_upload_status(upload_id uuid, next_status public.upload_status, note text) returns upload Rules: - Enforce allowed transitions. - Write upload_events STATUS_CHANGED with note.  F5) submit_doc_request(doc_request_id uuid) returns doc_request Rules: - Hard fail unless status is OPEN. - Require that required docs are present as uploads rows. - Set status SUBMITTED and submitted_at now().  F6) expire_doc_requests() scheduled job optional Rules: - Set EXPIRED where now() > expires_at and status not in (EXPIRED, CANCELED).  ======================== 7) RLS Lock ======================== RLS enabled on all public tables.  MVP policy model (LOCKED): - Service role performs all writes. - Anon can only read doc_request via valid token function return. - Broker authenticated role can read doc_requests and uploads scoped by broker_org_id. - Carrier never gets direct table access. Carrier uses token function only.  If auth is not implemented in v1.0: - Use server-only access with service_role key. - No client direct reads of tables. - All broker views served by server endpoints.  ======================== 8) Minimal HTTP Endpoints ======================== E1) POST /api/doc-requests Creates doc request and returns broker share link.  E2) GET /r/{token} Carrier upload page. Uses get_doc_request_by_token.  E3) POST /api/uploads/signed-url Returns signed upload URL for a specific storage_path. Server validates token and doc_type first.  E4) POST /api/uploads/complete Registers upload metadata and sha256, writes uploads row and event.  E5) POST /api/doc-requests/{id}/submit Calls submit_doc_request.  E6) POST /api/uploads/{id}/status Calls set_upload_status.  ======================== 9) UI Surfaces ======================== Broker Portal MVP: - Create doc request form - View doc request detail - See required docs checklist - See upload list with status - Accept or reject each upload with note - Submit doc request locked after carrier submits  Carrier Portal MVP: - Token entry via link - Upload required docs - Show per doc_type upload success - Submit done button triggers submit_doc_request  ======================== 10) Smoke Tests Required ======================== T1 Create doc request returns token and link T2 Token resolves once, then used token blocks T3 Upload file via signed URL and complete registers upload row T4 Submit fails if any required doc missing T5 Broker accept or reject changes upload status and logs event T6 Expired token blocks T7 Doc request expires when past expires_at T8 Canceled doc request blocks carrier actions  ======================== 11) Stop Conditions ======================== Stop when: - DDL applies cleanly in new Supabase project - RLS enabled and policies consistent with this contract - Broker can create and review doc requests - Carrier can upload and submit via token link - Audit trail is complete via upload_events - All smoke tests pass  End of contract.
Paste that into Claude and tell it: “Generate the DDL, RLS, functions, endpoints, and minimal Next.js UI to match this contract exactly. No invention. Hard fail on gaps.”
