# CarrierGate Clean Room

This repository is a clean-room rebuild.

Rules:
- CarrierGate only.
- Follow the master contract pasted by the user. If a spec is missing or ambiguous, stop and report the gap.
- Do not invent tables, columns, enums, or workflows.
- Output only what is explicitly requested.
- SQL must be rerunnable and safe for Supabase.

Initial deliverables:
- schema.sql
- rls.sql
- functions.sql
